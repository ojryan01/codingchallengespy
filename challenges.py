#Levret Munch
#Baby leverets can only eat a total of 10 carrots, and not any more.
#Write a function that takes in an array of integers that represent the number of carrots in each plot in a garden trail. 
#This function should return the number of plots a baby leveret will eat, only counting plots that can be eaten in completion. 
# (A leveret canâ€™t eat part of a plot.)
